**The most advanced Python solution to block "Auto Forward Telegram" bots, disable saving, and prevent content theft in 2025.**

If you run a Signal Channel (Crypto, Forex, Betting), leaks are costing you revenue. This tool fixes that instantly.

## 📉 The Problem
Manual banning doesn't work. Leakers use:
1.  **Auto-Forward Scripts:** They copy your message in <0.5 seconds.
2.  **Discord Bridges:** They mirror your feed to Discord servers.
3.  **Screenshot Tools:** They capture your signals as images.

## 🛡️ The Solution: TGAntiForward
This repository creates a secure "Gateway Bot". It does not send raw text; it processes every signal through a **Ghost Watermarking Engine** and wraps it in a **Latency Guard**.

### Features
* **🚫 Anti-Scraper:** Detects bot-speed clicks (under 0.8s) and feeds them Fake Data.
* **👻 Ghost Watermarks:** Injects invisible User IDs into images. If they leak it, you know who did it.
* **🔒 Native Shield:** Forces `protect_content=True` (No Forwarding/Saving).
* **🕵️ Honeypots:** Traps automated userbots.
